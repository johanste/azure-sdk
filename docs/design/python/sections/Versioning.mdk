## Versioning

~ Must
use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for your package. 
~

~ Must
use the `bN` pre-release segment for [preview releases](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#pre-releases). 

<<<<<<< HEAD
You **must not** use pre-release segments other than the ones defined in PEP440 (`aN`, `bN`, `rcN`) since build and publication tools and index servers may not sort the versions correctly.

~ Must
change the version number if *anything* changes in the library.
~

~ Must
increment the patch version if only bug fixes are added to the package.
~

~ Must
increment the minor version if any new functionality is added to the package.
~

~ Must
<<<<<<< HEAD
increment the minor version if the default REST api version is changed to a later version. This is required even if there is no public API change to the library as a result of using the new REST API version.

increment the minor version if the default REST API version is changed, even if there's no public API change to the library.

~ MustNot
increment the major version for a new REST API version unless it requires breaking API changes in the python library itself.
~

~ Must
<<<<<<< HEAD
increment the major version if there are breaking changes in the package. Breaking changes require prior approval from @adparch.

*Note: for non-preview packages, the bar for getting an exception to make a breaking change is extremely high and we may chose to create a new package with a different name in order to avoid diamond dependency issues.*

increment the major version if there are breaking changes in the package. Breaking changes require prior approval from [adparch](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk/issues).

The bar to make a breaking change is extremely high for GA client libraries.  We may create a new package with a different name to avoid diamond dependency issues.

### REST API method versioning

~ Must
<<<<<<< HEAD
use the latest known version of the service protocol when making requests. This is generally specified using a `ApiVersion` query parameter.
=======
use the latest service protocol version when making requests.

~ Must
allow a client application to specify an earlier version of the service protocol.
